# SeaHealth Roadmap

Bird's-eye view of every phase from project zero to submission.
Pair this with **`state.md`** at the repo root, which is the detailed task log
(per-sub-agent commits, audit verdicts, conflict resolutions).

- **This file**: phase-level "are we done?" tracker.
- **`state.md`**: task-level "what changed in commit X?" log.

Updated as phases land. ✅ = merged on `integrate/ship-12h`. ⏳ = in flight. ☐ = TODO.

## Phases

| 5 | Naomi REAL eval — adapter (xlsx → CSV) + run_eval + report | ✅ | `d2cb4f3` | First pass P=0.196 R=0.345 (250-ext); see Phase 6 for the 10k re-run |
| **6** | **Gap closure to fully meet `challenge.md` — full 10k extraction (Haiku 4.5), parallel workers, MLflow trace propagation, multi-attribute query** | **✅** | (this commit) | 10k facilities, 2784 with caps, 974 verified, 900 flagged. Eval re-scoped: P=0.488 R=0.362 F1=0.416 |
| 7 | Demo polish + submission (script, video, one-pager, packaging) | ☐ | — | Demo script locked at hour 24 per PHASES.md |
| **PR-0** | **Product Readiness baseline freeze — `docs/PRODUCT_READINESS_REPORT.md` generated; demo query + facility locked** | **✅** | (this commit) | 279 tests passing; gaps mapped to Phase 1–7 lanes |
| PR-1 | Phase 1 — MLflow traces + citation quality + contradiction recall | ☐ | — | Lanes 1A / 1B / 1C |
| PR-2 | Phase 2 — Vector Search live + Databricks substitution rationale | ☐ | — | Lanes 2A / 2B |
| PR-3 | Phase 3 — Live API UI + Facility audit trace view + Choropleth | ☐ | — | Lanes 3A / 3B / 3C |
| PR-4 | Phase 4 — Naomi repro + Aggregate CIs | ☐ | — | Lanes 4A / 4B |
| PR-5 | Phase 5 — Clean clone runtime + API hardening | ☐ | — | Lanes 5A / 5B |
| PR-6 | Phase 6 — Demo package + One-pager | ☐ | — | Lanes 6A / 6B |
| PR-7 | Phase 7 — Final integration + release tag | ☐ | — | `release/seahealth-submission` |
| Optional | R-3 Phase 3 reviewer, AUD-R audit-swarm reviewer, AUD-08 tautology cleanup | ☐ | — | Non-blocking; can run post-submission |

## Current state

- **Branch**: `integrate/ship-12h`
- **Latest test count**: 255 passing
- **Live data on disk**: `tables/{chunks.parquet, facilities_index.parquet, capabilities.parquet, facility_audits.parquet, demo_subset.json}` (all gitignored)
- **Live fixtures**: `fixtures/{summary,demo_query_appendectomy,facility_audit,map_aggregates}_demo.json` (real data, regenerated post-L-1)
- **Frontend**: `app/` — Map Workbench at `/`, demo data committed at `app/src/data/demoData.ts`

## Phase 5 — Naomi REAL eval (immediate next)

Naomi delivered `india_health_facilities_check_labels_final_v2.xlsx` — 30 facilities, 25 columns. Required adapter work because:

1. Her file uses `source_row_number` (e.g. 2164), not our `facility_id` (e.g. `vf_02164_<slug>`).
2. `claimed_capability` is multi-value semicolon-separated.
3. `evidence_status` includes `unclear`/`silent` in addition to `supports`/`contradicts`.

Adapter normalizes all three so `python -m seahealth.eval.run_eval --labels tables/naomi_labels.csv` writes a real precision/recall report to `docs/eval/naomi_run.md`.

## Phase 6 — Demo polish + submission

Outline (detailed plan deferred until Phase 5 lands):

- **Demo script** — 4-min, scripted to the second. Naomi drafts (per `PHASES.md` non-negotiable #2).
- **Demo video** — screen + voiceover walking through Map Workbench → Planner Query → Facility Audit View on CIMS Patna.
- **One-pager PDF** — judges' artifact: data left, product right, eval numbers (Naomi precision/recall) front and center.
- **Submission packaging** — README finalized, repo public, runtime instructions verified on a clean clone.
- **Optional reviewers** — AUD-R, R-3, AUD-08 tautology cleanup. None blocking.
